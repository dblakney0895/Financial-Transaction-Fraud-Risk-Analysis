# Financial Transaction Fraud Risk Analysis
### Fraud Pattern Exploration, Risk Indicators, and Ethical Considerations

## Business Context
Financial organizations face ongoing fraud risk that can lead to direct loss, reputational harm, and regulatory exposure. This project analyzes transaction-level data to identify risk indicators and patterns associated with fraudulent activity.

## Objective
- Explore fraud prevalence and key patterns
- Identify transaction features associated with higher risk
- Create a simple, explainable risk scoring approach (baseline)
- Document ethical and compliance considerations for fraud analytics

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive Statistics

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/` — data files (synthetic or public)
- `notebooks/` — analysis notebooks
- `screenshots/` — exported charts/visuals
- `executive_summary.md` — concise summary for non-technical readers

## Key Outputs
- EDA + visualizations (fraud rate, amount distribution, correlations)
- Risk indicators and interpretive findings
- Baseline risk scoring logic (transparent, non-ML)

## Notes
This repository uses **synthetic or public data** only. No proprietary or sensitive information is included.
